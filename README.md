# SciCal600

SciCal600 is an independent Smart Calculator platform for Web, Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows. The same product-neutral calculation engines power the scientific, Linear Algebra, Computer Calculator, and Economics Calculator workspaces.

SciCal600 is the primary project. This repository also keeps two standalone auxiliary computer-architecture calculators:

- [`lmc/`](lmc/): Little Man's Computer assembler and simulator
- [`systembussing/`](systembussing/): CPU, register, memory, control-signal, and system-bus simulator

## Download and use

- **Web:** https://scical600.pages.dev/
- **macOS / Windows / iOS Simulator:** open this repository's **Releases** page and download the client build for the desired commit/version.
- **Android testing channel:** [Release details](https://github.com/justinfromhkg/SciCal600/releases/tag/android-debug-latest) · [direct APK](https://github.com/justinfromhkg/SciCal600/releases/download/android-debug-latest/SciCal600-debug.apk) · [SHA-256](https://github.com/justinfromhkg/SciCal600/releases/download/android-debug-latest/SHA256SUMS) · [file size](https://github.com/justinfromhkg/SciCal600/releases/download/android-debug-latest/size.txt). This is a public prerelease signed with a development key, not the production-signed stable app.
- Detailed packaging and signing notes: [CLIENTS.md](CLIENTS.md)

Main-branch client builds are automated. macOS and Windows packages are currently unsigned, so their operating systems can show publisher warnings. The iOS artifact is an unsigned Simulator build; a physical iPhone/iPad build requires Apple Developer signing credentials and provisioning.

## Product independence

SciCal600 does not require a specific third-party calculator, firmware, ROM, manual, logo, product artwork, or proprietary calculator service to run. Calculation behavior is implemented in this repository. Production bundles are checked for legacy third-party product labels before native packaging.

See [BRAND-INDEPENDENCE.md](BRAND-INDEPENDENCE.md) for the repository policy. This engineering policy reduces avoidable brand/copying risk but is not a substitute for legal review before commercial distribution or advertising.

Copyright-safety rules, dependency licenses, external data sources, and the pre-release checklist are recorded in [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md). The package is marked `UNLICENSED` until ownership and contributor permissions are confirmed and the maintainer deliberately selects a source-code license.

## Workspaces

Direct Web routes:

- `/scientific-calculator`
- `/linear-algebra`
- `/computer-calculator`
- `/economics-calculator`
- LMC: `https://lmc.scical600.pages.dev/` (fallback: `/lmc/`)
- SystemBussing: `https://systembussing.scical600.pages.dev/` (fallback: `/systembussing/`)
- `/manual`
- `/about`

The project has no browser runtime package dependency. Native wrappers bundle the same static `dist/` application for offline use.

## Test and build

```text
npm ci
npm test
npm run brand:check
```

`npm run brand:check` first builds `dist/`, then verifies that the shipped bundle does not contain the retired third-party model/vendor labels.

Browser regression tests:

```text
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:browser
```

## Native clients

Android:

```text
npm run android:debug
```

Desktop staging:

```text
npm run desktop:prepare
```

The GitHub workflow packages the staged app with pinned Electron/electron-builder versions on native macOS and Windows runners.

iOS project generation:

```text
npm ci
npm run ios:sync
```

The iOS GitHub job builds an unsigned Simulator app. Physical-device distribution requires Apple signing/provisioning credentials; they must be supplied through secure CI secrets rather than committed to the repository.

## Implemented calculation features

- Two-line editable expression/result display with replay history
- Calculation priority, brackets, implicit multiplication, percentages, powers, roots, factorial, and absolute value
- Trigonometric, inverse/hyperbolic, exponential, logarithmic, permutation, and combination functions
- Degree, radian, and grad angle units
- `Ans`, independent memory, fractions/decimals, DMS, normal/fixed/scientific/engineering notation
- Complex arithmetic in rectangular and polar form
- BASE-N arithmetic and logical operations
- Weighted single-variable statistics and multiple regression models
- Four persistent program areas with safe execution controls
- Searchable educational formula and scientific-constant catalogues
- Linear Algebra operations including inverse, determinant, adjugate, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors
- Computer-number-system, ALU, IEEE 754, LMC, memory, bus, cache, disk, DMA, and performance tools
- Economics tools for FX reference data, Hong Kong public rates, interest, savings, mortgage scenarios, APR/IRR, amortization, budgeting, and real returns
- Twelve interface languages and responsive phone/desktop layouts
- Parser implementation without JavaScript `eval`
- A title-bar heart Easter egg with a browser animation and downloadable ANSI-terminal C11 source

## Cloudflare Pages

The production deployment workflow is `.github/workflows/cloudflare-pages.yml`. To enable automatic production deployment, configure the repository's Cloudflare credentials and `CLOUDFLARE_PAGES_ENABLED=true`; secrets must not be committed.

Manual deployment:

```text
npm run deploy
```

The deployment command publishes the primary `main` site and refreshes the `lmc.scical600.pages.dev` and `systembussing.scical600.pages.dev` branch aliases from the `lmc/` and `systembussing/` directories in this repository's `main` branch.

## GitHub Actions

- `.github/workflows/cloudflare-pages.yml`: Web deployment
- `.github/workflows/android.yml`: Android build, verification, emulator smoke test, APK publishing
- `.github/workflows/clients.yml`: product-neutral validation, macOS/Windows packaging, iOS Simulator build, GitHub Release publishing

The workflows are intentionally separated so a platform-specific packaging failure does not overwrite or silently replace another platform's build logic.
